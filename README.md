# Steps:
1.  create a directory named `img` in the `dataset` directory. Then put dataset files in the directory.
    ( `./dataset/img/`)
2.  Offline data (./dataset/*.csv) must be generated first.
    (You can generate it by the command `python Closet_Data_Generator.py`)
    ( If the offline data had been generated, our system will ask if you'd like to overwrite it.)
3.  Check if the above data were generated before preprocessing with HW4_main_103703010_103703015.py
    (You can open the GUI by the command `python HW4_main_103703010_103703015.py`)

# Parameter
Images of mosaic dataset are located at "./dataset/img/"
